# Cold Fingers

Answers to Duke University's Managing Big Data with MySQL Course (2017). 

*If you're wondering what the name means - my fingers were cold when I made this.*

### Lecture Notes

* Week 1 - ER Diagrams, RS, database concepts
* Week 2 - Select, where, from, order by, limit, operations
* Week 3 - Group by, having, distinct, operators
* Week 3 - Inner Joins, Outer Joins + examples
* Week 4 - Subqueries & more Operators + examples

*Note: For Week 3 & 4, I chose to focus more on* examples *of joins instead of lengthy theoretical explanations of what joins are. I wrote it this way because I realised that I'd simply be paraphrasing Duke's notes which isn't efficient or honest. So I focused on listing examples that helped me understand the concepts better.*
